**What is @Primary annotation for?**
In Spring framework, the `@Primary` annotation is used to give higher preference to a bean, when there are multiple beans of same type.

The `@Primary` annotation may be used on any class directly or indirectly annotated with `@Component` or on methods annotated with `@Bean`.
