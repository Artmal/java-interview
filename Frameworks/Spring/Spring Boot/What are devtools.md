## What are Spring Boot DevTools?
Spring Boot DevTools introduces the following features:
1. Automatic disable for template(ex. Thymeleaf) caching enabling you to see changes live.
2. Whenever files change in the classpath, applications using spring-boot-devtools will cause the application to restart.
3. Live Reload. DevTools include an embedded LiveReload server that is used to trigger a browser refresh when a resource is changed.
For this to happen in the browser we need to install the LiveReload plugin.
