## What is progressive enhancement?
As more and more web-enabled devices come onto the market, this concept is becoming more widely adopted. 

It's not just screen sizes that are varied - connection speeds and capabilities of each device can also differ. 

Also, some people browse with JavaScript turned off, so you need to make sure that the page still works for them.

So the idea is that on very basic level we have html - our content.

Then we add to this or enhance what we have by applying some css rules. 

Then we can add some JavaScript functionality.
