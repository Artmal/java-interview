## What is prototyped-based inheritance?
Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming where classes are not present, and behaviour reuse(or inheritance in class-based languages) is performed by cloning existing objects that server as prototypes.

The advantage/disadvantage is that we can create new kinds of objects at run time without need for defining classes(static code).
