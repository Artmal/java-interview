## Abstract Factory
**Intent**
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**Example:**
java.sql interfaces all get their concrete implementations from JDBC JAR when driver is registered.

DriverManager finds appropriate driver and from this driver he calls connect() method. All drivers now how to create connections which are specific to their database. Although we don't want to know about implementation of the connection, we just want to use it.
