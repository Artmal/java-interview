## Design Patterns overview
 **Abstract Factory**
 Do we need to create families of objects.  
 **Builder**
 Do we need to create object in several steps.  
**Prototype**
Do we have too many classes to instantiate / or is the object creation a cumbersome process.  
**Singleton**
Do we need to limit the no of objects of a class.  
**Adapter**
Do we have the right stuff but wrong interface.  
**Composite**
Do we have units and groups and want to treat them the same way.  
**Decorator**
Do we need multiple additional functions we may need to apply, but which and how many we add varies, without sub classing.  
**Facade**
Do we want simplify, beautify or OO-fy an existing class or subsystem.  
**Proxy**
Do we need to optionally add some new functionality to something that already exists. Do we need to control how an object is accessed.  
**Chain of Responsibility**
Do we have diff. objects that can do the job but we do not want the client object know which is actually going to do it.  
A **flyweight** is an object that minimizes memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects; it is a way to use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation would use an unacceptable amount of memory.  
The **memento** pattern is a software design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback).
