## Singleton Design Pattern
**Intent**

 - Ensure class has only once instance and provide a global point of access to it.

**Problem**
Application needs one and only one instance of an object. Additionally, lazy initialization and global access are necessary.

Best singleton according to Joshua Bloch is enum because
1. Multithread support out of the box.
2. **Serialization tolerance support out of the box.**
	Suppose you serialize an object of a singleton class. Then if you de-serialize that object it will create a new instance and hence break the singleton pattern.
	
	Serialization treats `enum`s specially. Basically, it stores only a reference to its `class` and the name of the constant. Upon deserialization, this information is used to lookup the existing runtime object of the `enum` type.

	Thus, if you deserialize the `enum` constant within the same runtime, you will get the same runtime instance you have serialized.
3. **Reflection tolerance out of the box.**
	Java internally ensures that enums are initialized only once.
