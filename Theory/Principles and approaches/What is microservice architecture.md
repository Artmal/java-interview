## What is microservice architecture?
There are two main ways to build application: monolithic architecture and microservice architecture.

In case of microservices architecture we gain the following:
1. Loose coupled components are much more easy to redeploy, manage and scale.
2. We can introduce new technology stack to our project as microservices usually speak via HTTP protocol which can be supported by any enterprise language.
