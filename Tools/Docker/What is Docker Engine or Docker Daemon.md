Docker Engine is a client-server application with these major components:

    A server which is a type of long-running program called a daemon process (the dockerd command).

    A REST API which specifies interfaces that programs can use to talk to the daemon and instruct it what to do.

    A command line interface (CLI) client (the docker command).
