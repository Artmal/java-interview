**What is Inversion of Control(IoC)?**
Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering by which the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework.

By contrast with traditional programming, in which our custom code makes calls to a library, IoC enables a framework to take control of the flow of a program and make calls to our custom code.
