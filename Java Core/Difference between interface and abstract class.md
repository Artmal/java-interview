## What are the differences between interface and abstract class?

 - Methods and members of an abstract class can be defined with any
   visibility, whereas interface methods can be declared with `public`
   identifier.
   
 - An abstract class can have constructor - interface can't. Abstract
   classes constructors are generally used for super calls for
   initialization events common to all the subclasses
 - In an interface all variables are final(constants) - abstract class
   can define non-final variables.
