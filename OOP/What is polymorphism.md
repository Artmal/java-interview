## **What is polymorphism?**

**Theory**
 - Polymorphism describes a pattern in object oriented programming in which classes have different functionality while sharing a common interface.
 - The ability of different objects to respond, each in its own way, to identical messages.

There are several types of polymorphism:

 1. Ad hoc polymorphism.
Is a kind of polymorphism in which polymorphic functions can be applied to arguments of different types, because a polymorphic function can denote a number of distinct and potentially heterogeneous implementations depending on the type of argument(s) to which it is applied.
 2. Parametric polymorphism.
Using parametric polymorphism, a function or a data type can be written generically so that it can handle values identically without depending on their type.
 3. Subtyping.
Function can receive arguments of supertype and all of it's inheritors.
