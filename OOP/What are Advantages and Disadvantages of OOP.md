## What are advantages and disadvantages of OOP?
**Advantages**
1. OOP is modular, as it provides separation of duties in object-based program development. It is also extensible, as objects can be extended to include new attributes and behaviors. Object can also be reused within an across applications. Because of these three factors - modularity, extensibility, and reusability - object-oriented programming provides improved software-development productivity over traditional procedure-based programming techniques.

2. Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale changes.

**Disadvantages**
1. Steep learning curve: The thought process involved in object-oriented programming may not be natural for some people, and it can take time to get used to it. It is complex to create programs based on interactions of objects. Some of the key programming techniques, such as inheritance and polymorphism, can be challenging to comprehend initially. 
2. Large program size: Object-oriented programs typically involve more lines of code than procedural programs.
3. Slower programs: Object-oriented programs are typically slower than procedure-based programs, as they typically require more instruction to be executed.
4. Not suitable for all types of problems: There are problems that lend themselves well to functional-programming style, logic-programming style, or procedure-based programming style, and applying object-oriented programming in those situations will not result in efficient programs.
