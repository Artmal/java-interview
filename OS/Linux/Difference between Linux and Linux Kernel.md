## What are the differences between Linux and Linux Kernel?
An OS comprise of two components: Kernel and Shell. Kernel is the program which runs in background and convert all your commands to machine dependent signals. It is the core of the OS. Shell is the interface between the user and the kernel. Shell may be command line interface or graphical user interface.

You don't use kernel on its own. You always need the shell. If you combine the kernel and the shell, you get a complete distribution.
